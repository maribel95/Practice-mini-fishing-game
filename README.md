# Practice-mini-fishing-game
This is a fishing simulator. It is played through the terminal, where a menu with different options will be displayed.

- Choose fishing. In this case, the locations are Florida and the Mediterranean.
- Register user.
- Unsubscribe user.
- Start fishing.
- Game statistics. They can be reviewed by individual user, or globally for all players. Even if a user has lost their license, their statistics will still be recorded and will continue to contribute to the overall statistics report.

One of the fundamental requirements to go fishing is to have first registered our user. Registering would be the equivalent of granting a license to go fishing. So if we unsubscribed that same user, his license would be withdrawn and he would no longer be able to fish again until he recovered it.

When you choose the option to go fishing at a fishery, it will be necessary to enter the username to check if it has the license or not.

The licensing system has been controlled. You cannot unsubscribe a user that does not exist. Nor register a user who is already registered.
